Systems:
-selection system:
	-modes:
		-select mode
		-deselect mode
	-uses state pattern?
-move system
	-uses command pattern
-turn system
	-ui
	-dictates which pieces can be selected
	-uses observer pattern?


-current problem:
	-can't distinguish between capture tiles and movement tiles
		-make 2 lists
			-1 for movement tiles
			-1 for capture tiles

	-what should handle selection responsibility?
		-probably the selection states
	
	-how do we handle turn changes and player priority?
		-try looking in the event handler?
